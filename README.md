# Dota2-chat-text-mining
This project collected nearly 30,000 text chat of DOTA2 games., Apply LDA model to calculate the most frequently discussed topics in the game. Conduct trend analysis in a game and observe the trend of the topic changes. Utilize N-GRAM method to vectorize original text data. And establish classification model to predict the outcome of the game via SVM and MNB. Evaluate the performance of the model for balanced dataset with accuracy, which was 18% better than random guess. Plot ROC curve and calculate AUC score to evaluate the performance of the model in the imbalanced data set. Finally, it is found that the performance of the classification model is similar. Analyze the informative feature to interpret each model. As a result, features of the SVM model are more convincing.
